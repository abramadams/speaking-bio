Abram Adams has been developing for the web and desktop since the turn of the century and has specialized in CFML application development for most of that time.  His career has led him through many industries such as software, government, travel and agriculture where he has learned and utilized a variety of front-end, back-end and hybrid web technologies.

He is currently the Senior Developer for a world-wide bull semen marketing company (yeah, you read that right) where he spearheads the development of several in-house and internationally deployed applications such as a custom CRM system, Order Management system, ERP integrations, automated catalog generators, and a ton more.

His community efforts include the website: www.trycf.com, which focuses on teaching CFML to would-be web developers as well as giving a handy resource for running CFML code against a variety of CFML engines.  His passion is to help to build the CFML community and to help raise a new generation of CFML-aware web developers.
