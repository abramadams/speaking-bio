Abram has been developing for the web and desktop since the turn of the century and has specialized in ColdFusion application development for most of that time.  His career path has led him through many industries such as software, government, travel and agriculture where he has learned and utilized a variety of front-end and back-end web technologies.

He is currently the Senior Developer for a world-wide bull semen marketing company (yeah, you read that right) where he spearheads the development of several in-house and internationally deployed applications such as a custom CRM system, Order Management system, automated catalog generators, and a ton more.  

His community efforts include the website: www.trycf.com, which focuses on teaching CFML to would-be web developers as well as giving a handy resource for running CFML code against a variety of CFML engines.  His passion is to help to build the CF community and to help raise a new generation of CF-aware web developers.

He lives in a small town in the California Central Valley, where he and his wife of 18 years raise their 3 boys and 1 princess.  Camping, fishing, karate and pretty much whatever sport/activity his kids are involved in at the moment is how he spends his free time... well that and resolving git merge conflicts...
